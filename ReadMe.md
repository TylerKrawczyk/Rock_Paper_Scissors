This is my final Rock Paper Scissors project for The Odin Project!

For the first part of this project, I was tasked to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in the console. For the second part, I was tasked to create a physical browser game using HTML, CSS and Javascript utilizing quite a bit of DOM Manipulation. 

These are the things that I learned:

-The relationship between HTML, CSS and Javascript 
-How to call functions
-Use of arrow functions (while it was minimal, definitely helpful)
-Use DOM Manipulation Methods (creating HTML elements in Javascript, editing exisiting HTML methods in Javascript
-The use of for/while loops
-calling Javascript functions

You can see it live in the browser here- https://tylerkrawczyk.github.io/RPS_Live_Preview/
